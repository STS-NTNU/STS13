At least three Democrats are considering splitting from the party while no-one has yet nominated to contest the leadership. Three of the "gang of four" senators who ousted Natasha Stott Despoja from the leadership are considering forming a new "progressive centre" party in the fallout from last week's turmoil. This would leave the Democrats with a rump of three or four members. West Australian Senator Andrew Murray said yesterday unless the Democrats left wing gave ground the party would split.
