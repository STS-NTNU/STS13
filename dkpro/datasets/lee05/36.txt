The spectre of Osama bin Laden rose again today, urging Afghans to launch a new Jihad, or holy war, and predicting the fall of the United States, in a hand-written "letter" posted on an Islamic website.  There was no hard proof that the scruffy missive was genuine, but IslamOnline.net said it had been received by their correspondent in Jalalabad, eastern Afghanistan, from an Afghan source who asked to remain anonymous. The source claimed it was the "most recent letter" from the world's most wanted man.
