Australia's Commonwealth Bank on Wednesday said it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs even as it reported its profit rose 11 percent last fiscal year. Workers reacted angrily to the planned cuts, which Australia's second largest bank said were designed to control costs. The cuts will take effect this financial year. The bank reported net profit of 2.66 billion Australian dollars ($1.4 billion) in the year to June 30, up from 2.4 billion Australian dollars in the previous year.
