A U.S.-British air raid in southern Iraq left eight civilians dead and nine wounded, the Iraqi military said Sunday. The military told the official Iraqi News Agency that the warplanes bombed areas in Basra province, 330 miles south of Baghdad.  The U.S. Central Command in Florida said coalition aircraft used precision-guided weapons to strike two air defense radar systems near Basra "in response to recent Iraqi hostile acts against coalition aircraft monitoring the Southern No-Fly Zone."
