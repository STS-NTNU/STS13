Washington has sharply rebuked Russia over bombings of Georgian villages, warning the raids violated Georgian sovereignty and could worsen tensions between Moscow and Tbilisi. "The United States regrets the loss of life and deplores the violation of Georgia's sovereignty," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.  Mr Fleischer said US Secretary of State Colin Powell had delivered the same message to his Russian counterpart but that the stern language did not reflect a sign of souring relations between Moscow and Washington.
