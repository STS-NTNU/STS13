The Bush administration has drawn up plans to escalate the war of words against Iraq, with new campaigns to step up pressure on Baghdad and rally world opinion behind the US drive to oust President Saddam Hussein. This week, the State Department will begin mobilising Iraqis from across North America, Europe and the Arab world, training them to appear on talk shows, write opinion articles and give speeches on reasons to end President Saddam's rule.
