The United Nations World Food Program estimates that up to 14 million people in seven countries - Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Angola, Swaziland, Lesotho and Zimbabwe - face death by starvation unless there is a massive international response. In Malawi, as many as 10,000 people may have already died. The signs of malnutrition - swollen stomachs, stick-thin arms, light-coloured hair - are everywhere.
