Senior members of the Saudi royal family paid at least $560 million to Osama bin Laden's terror group and the Taliban for an agreement his forces would not attack targets in Saudi Arabia, according to court documents. The papers, filed in a $US3000 billion ($5500 billion) lawsuit in the US, allege the deal was made after two secret meetings between Saudi royals and leaders of al-Qa'ida, including bin Laden. The money enabled al-Qa'ida to fund training camps in Afghanistan later attended by the September 11 hijackers. The disclosures will increase tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia.
