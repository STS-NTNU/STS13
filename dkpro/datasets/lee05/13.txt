Drug squad detectives have asked the Police Ombudsman to investigate the taskforce that is examining allegations of widespread corruption within the squad. This coincides with the creation of a special unit within the taskforce to track the spending of at least 10 serving and former squad members.  The corruption taskforce, codenamed Ceja, will check tax records and financial statements in a bid to establish if any of the suspects have accrued unexplained wealth over the past seven years. But drug squad detectives have countered with their own set of allegations, complaining to the ombudsman that the internal investigation is flawed, biased and over-zealous.
