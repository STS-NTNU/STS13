Palestinian hired gun Abu Nidal, whose violent death was reported last week from Baghdad, was murdered on the orders of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein after refusing to train al-Qa'ida fighters based in Iraq, reports said yesterday. Iraqi intelligence chief Taher Jalil Habbush said last Wednesday Abu Nidal had shot and killed himself after being discovered living illegally in Baghdad and facing interrogation for anti-Iraqi activities. But Western diplomats believe the radical militant was killed for refusing to reactivate his international terrorist network.
