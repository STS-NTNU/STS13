Labor needed to distinguish itself from the Government on the issue of asylum seekers, Greens leader Bob Brown has said. His Senate colleague Kerry Nettle intends to move a motion today - on the first anniversary of the Tampa crisis - condemning the Government over its refugee policy and calling for an end to mandatory detention. "We Greens want to bring the Government to book over its serial breach of international obligations as far as asylum seekers in this country are concerned," Senator Brown said today.
