The Federal Government did not regret its actions 12 months on from the Tampa asylum seeker crisis, Small Business Minister Joe Hockey said today.  Mr Hockey said the Government was not embarrassed by the Tampa issue, which began on August 27 of last year when the captain of the Norwegian cargo ship rescued more than 400 asylum seekers from an Indonesian ferry north of Christmas Island.
