In Malawi, as in other countries in the region, AIDS is making the effects of the famine much worse. The overall HIV infection rate in Malawi is 19 per cent, but in some areas up to 35 percent of people are infected. A significant proportion of the young adult population is too sick to do any productive work. Malnutrition causes people to succumb to the disease much more quickly than they do in the West, and hunger forces women into prostitution in order to feed their families, making them more vulnerable to contracting the disease. Life expectancy has been reduced to 40 years.
