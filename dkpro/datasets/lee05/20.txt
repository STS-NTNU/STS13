The United Nations was determined that its showpiece environment summit - the biggest conference the world has ever witnessed - should be staged in Africa. The venue, however, could not be further removed from the grim realities of life in the rest of Africa. Johannesburg's exclusive and formerly whites-only suburb of Sandton is the wealthiest neighbourhood in the continent. Just a few kilometres from Sandton begins the sprawling Alexandra township, where nearly a million people live in squalor. Organisers of the conference, which begins today, seem determined that the two worlds should be kept as far apart as possible. Tight security surrounds Sandton's convention centre and five-star hotels, where world leaders will debate poverty, the environment and sustainable development while enjoying lavish hospitality.
