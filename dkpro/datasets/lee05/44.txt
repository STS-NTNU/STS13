The Russian defense minister said residents shouldn't feel threatened by the growing number of Chinese workers seeking employment in the country's sparsely populated Far Eastern and Siberian regions. There are no exact figures for the number of Chinese working in Russia, but estimates range from 200,000 to as many as 5 million. Most are in the Russian Far East, where they arrive with legitimate work visas to do seasonal work on Russia's low-tech, labor-intensive farms.
