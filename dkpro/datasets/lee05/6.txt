A gay former student of a Melbourne Christian school is taking legal action under equal opportunity legislation, claiming the school discriminated against him because of his sexuality. Tim, 16, alleged a staff member at Hillcrest Christian College in Berwick told him he "had the devil in him", and constant bullying by students prompted the principal to tell him to hide his sexuality. He left the school several weeks ago and is continuing Year 10 by distance education after he said homophobic bullies threw rocks at his head, spat on him, called him names and slashed his belongings.
