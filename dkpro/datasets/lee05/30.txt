A man accused of making hidden-camera footage up the skirts of women also made child pornography of the worst kind, featuring the rape of children as young as 6, police said Friday. The latest allegations suggest there's nothing humorous about voyeurs who some may perceive to be making secret videos as a joke, Staff-Insp. Gary Ellis said. "Approximately 20 per cent of voyeurs have also committed sexual assault or rape," Ellis said, reading from a recently released federal government report on criminal voyeurism.
