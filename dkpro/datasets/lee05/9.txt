Hunan province remained on high alert last night as thunderstorms threatened to exacerbate the flood crisis, now entering its fifth day and with 108 already dead and hundreds of thousands evacuated. On the flood frontline at Dongting Lake, the water level peaked at just under 35m on Saturday night, then eased about 3cm during the day under a hot sun, with temperatures reaching 35C. But with the lake still brimming at dangerously high levels, and spilling over the top of its banks in some places, locals were fearful that a thunderstorm and high winds forecast to hit the region last night would damage the dikes. About 1800km of dikes around the lake are all that stand between 10 million people in the surrounding farmland and disaster.
