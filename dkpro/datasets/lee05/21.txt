The Iraqi capital is agog after the violent death of one of the world's most notorious terrorists, but the least of the Palestinian diplomat's worries was the disposal of Abu Nidal's body, which lay on a slab in an undisclosed Baghdad morgue. Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council is held responsible for the death or injury of almost 1000 people in 20 countries across Europe and the Middle East in the three decades since he fell out with Yasser Arafat over what Abu Nidal saw as Arafat's willingness to accommodate Israel in the Palestinian struggle.
