Sri Lanka's government will lift a four-year ban on Tamil Tiger rebels on Sept. 6, paving the way for peace talks with the insurgents scheduled for later that month in Thailand, a government minister said Saturday. "We will lift the ban as promised," Minister for Rehabilitation Jayalath Jayawardena told The Associated Press. The lifting of the ban is one of the key rebel conditions for resuming peace negotiations with the government after a hiatus of more than seven years.
