Police are combing through videotapes trying to spot the gunman dressed in black who shot a 30-year-old man to death at a downtown massage parlour. The victim was hit in the stomach and upper body and died about 3 1/2 hours later in hospital. The woman was not hurt. Police urged business owners to turn over any security-camera videotapes they might have that recorded people on the street at the time. Several such videos are now being reviewed.
