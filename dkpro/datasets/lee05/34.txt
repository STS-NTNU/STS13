A young humpback whale remained tangled in a shark net off the Gold Coast yesterday, despite valiant efforts by marine rescuers. With its head snared by the net and an anchor rope wrapped around its tail, the stricken whale was still swimming but hopes for its survival were fading. A second rescue attempt was planned for dawn today after rescuers braved heavy seas, strong wind and driving rain to try to free the whale.
