An Islamic high court in northern Nigeria rejected an appeal today by a single mother sentenced to be stoned to death for having sex out of wedlock. Clutching her baby daughter, Amina Lawal burst into tears as the judge delivered the ruling.  Lawal, 30, was first sentenced in March after giving birth to a daughter more than nine months after divorcing.
