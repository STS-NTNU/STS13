Researchers conducting the most elaborate wild goose chase in history are digesting the news that a bird they have tracked for over 4,500 miles is about to be cooked. Kerry, an Irish light-bellied Brent goose, was one of six birds tagged in Northern Ireland in May by researchers monitoring the species' remarkable migration. Last week, however, he was found dead in an Inuit hunter's freezer in Canada, still wearing his Â£3,000 satelite tracking device. Kerry was discovered by researchers on the remote Cornwallis Island. They picked up the signal and decided to try to find him.
