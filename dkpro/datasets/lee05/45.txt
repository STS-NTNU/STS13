Australian spies listened to conversations between Norway's ambassador and its foreign office during the Tampa crisis, a soon to be published book will reveal.  Phone calls were tapped by the Defence Signals Directorate when Norwegian ambassador Ove Thorsheim visited the freighter during the stand-off.  A book, Tampa, to be published in Norway in October, recounts the events which triggered Australia's Pacific Solution and transformed Tampa Captain Arne Rinnan into a homeland hero.
