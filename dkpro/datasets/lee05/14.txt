Queensland senator Andrew Bartlett has launched a last-minutebid to rescue the Australian Democrats from a split that threatens to destroy the party. With nominations for the party leadership to close on Wednesday night, Senator Bartlett met last night with deputy leader Aden Ridgeway to offer him a place on a unity ticket and set up a reform process to begin healing the party's wounds. Party sources said Senator Ridgeway, who turned against former leader Natasha Stott Despoja, is still expected to contest the leadership against one of her two supporters: Senator Bartlett or Brian Greig, installed as interim leader by the party's executive last Thursday.
