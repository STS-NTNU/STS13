\label{sec:systems}

The three submitted systems consist of one using only the soft cardinality features 
described in Section \ref{softcard-optimisation} ({\bf NTNU-run1}), 
one system using a baseline set of lexical measures and WordNet augmented similarity 
in addition to the new sublexical representation measures ({\bf NTNU-run2}), 
and one ({\bf NTNU-run3}) which combines the output from the other two systems 
by taking the mean of the two sets of predictions. 
NTNU-run3 thus represents a combination of the measures and methods introduced by NTNU-run1 and NTNU-run2.

In addition to the sublexical feature measures described in Section~\ref{ngram-optimisation},
NTNU-run2 uses the following baseline features adapted from the TakeLab 2012 system 
submission \cite{saric2012takelab}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple lexical features: Relative document length differences, number overlap, case overlap and stock symbol named entity recognition.
\item Lemma and word n-gram overlap of orders 1-3;
frequency weighted lemma and word overlap; and
WordNet augmented overlap.
\item Cosine similarity between the summed word representation vectors from each sentence using LSI models based on large corpora with or without frequency weighting.
\end{itemize}

The specific measures used in the submitted systems were found by training the regression model on the STS 2012 shared task data and evaluating on the STS 2013 test data. We used a stepwise forward feature selection method by comparing mean (but unweighted) correlation on the four test categories in order to identify the subset of measures to include in the final system.

The system composes a feature set of similarity scores from these 20 baseline measures and the nine sublexical representation measures, and uses these to train a bagged SVM regressor as described in Section~\ref{sec:regression} in order to predict the final semantic similarity score for new sentence pairs.
