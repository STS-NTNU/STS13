\label{sec:regression}

The sentence pair similarity score is predicted by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model using Radial Basis (RBF) kernel function. The model is trained on the combined test data for the 2013 STS shared task and the trial and test data of the SemEval 2012 STS shared task. The combined dataset consists of ca. 7500 sentence pairs from nine different sources. The regression model is trained as a bagged classifier. I.e. for each run 100 such regression models was built with a set of training samples and features with size to 80\% of the original features and samples drawn with replacement. The prediction of the regression models are averaged into a final prediction. This introduces additional regularization in an attempt to reduce the instability of results between different test sets.

The SVM regression models were trained with default parameters provided in the implementation, which are Cost penalty (C) 1.0, margin ($\epsilon$) 0.1 and RBF precision ($\gamma$) $1/|feature count|$. It was not possible to improve the performance over these defaults by cross validation parameter search unless the dataset was split up along the different data sources.
