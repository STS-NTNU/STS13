\label{sec:regression}

The final sentence pair similarity score is predicted by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with a Radial Basis (RBF) kernel \cite{VapnikEA:97}. The model is trained on the combined test data for the 2013 STS shared task and the trial and test data of the SemEval 2012 STS shared task. The combined dataset consists of about 7500 sentence pairs from nine different text categories. 
The SVR model is trained as a bagged classifier, that is, for each run 100 regression models are trained with 80\% of the samples and features of the original training set drawn with replacement. The outputs of all models are averaged into a final prediction. 
This bagged training procedure adds extra regularization that can reduce the instability of prediction accuracy between different test data categories. 

The prediction pipeline was implemented with the Scikit-learn software framework \cite{scikit-learn},
and the SVR models were trained with the implementation's default parameters:
cost penalty (C) 1.0, margin ($\epsilon$) 0.1 and RBF precision ($\gamma$) $1/|feature count|$. 
We were unable to improve the performance over these defaults by cross validation parameter search 
unless the models were trained for specific text categories. Consequently no parameter optimization was performed during training of the final systems.
