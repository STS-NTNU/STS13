The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) shared task aims at providing a unified framework for evaluating textual semantic similarity, ranging from exact semantic equivalence to completely unrelated texts. This is represented by the prediction of a similarity score between two sentences, drawn from a particular category of text, which ranges from 0 (different topics) to 5 (exactly equivalent) through six grades of semantic similarity \cite{agirre-EtAl:2013:*SEM1}.
This paper describes the NTNU submission to the SemEval 2014 STS shared task (Task~10). 
The approach is based on the lexical and distributional features of the baseline TakeLab system 
from the 2012 shared task \cite{saric2012takelab} and improves on it in three ways,
by adding two new categories of features and by using a bagging regression model to predict similarity scores. 

The new feature categories added are based on soft cardinality and character n-grams,
described in Section~\ref{sec:methods}.
The parameters of the two categories are optimised over several corpora and the features
combined through support vector regression (Section~\ref{sec:optimisation})
to create the actual systems (Section~\ref{sec:systems}).
As Section~\ref{sec:results} shows, the new measures give 
the baseline system a substantial boost, leading to
very competitive results in the shared task evaluation.
