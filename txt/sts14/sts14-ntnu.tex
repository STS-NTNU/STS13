\begin{abstract}
The paper describes the approaches taken by the NTNU team
to the SemEval 2014  Semantic Textual Similarity  shared task.
%  (Task~10).
The solutions combine measures based on lexical soft cardinality 
and character n-gram feature representations
with  lexical distance metrics from TakeLab's baseline system. 
The final NTNU system is based on bagged support vector machine regression
over the datasets from previous shared tasks and shows highly
competitive performance, being the
best  system on three of the datasets and third
best overall (on weighted mean over all six datasets).
